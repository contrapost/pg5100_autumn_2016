            OPTIMISTIC_FORCE_INCREMENT is quite rare.
            It is needed when in a transaction an entity is not modified, but still
            the fact that it has participated in the transaction should rollback
            all the other transactions currently using such entity.
            For example, adding X to a list in Y (eg unidirectional OneToMany relation)
            does not change X.

            Note: in this example, you might think a business case would be to prevent
            two transactions each one adding the same book to a different shelf.
            Yes, that would do, but unnecessary, as the second transaction to complete
            would fail anyway due to constraint violation of OneToMany (instead it would
            had work for ManyToMany)
